# Cash Flow

I am changing all the nodes in the hierarchy to be based on cash flow.  

Checking is the top -level cash flow.  Money comes in and goes out.  The goal of any cashflow is to have a positive balance.  The balance may carry over to the next cycle.  

So a cashflow is organized into cycles, defined by a date or a specific transaction.   There is only one end of cycle event.  The start of the cycle is the previous end of cycle event.  

Think of the checking account as the essential cashflow.  Because it has every type of transaction: income, expenses.  Transfers and payments are a different kind of transaction.

So let's list them.

Transctions:
 - Income (variable or fixed)
 - Expense (variable or fixed)
 - Cash  (unexpected income or expense) 
 - Checks (variable or fixed)
 - Payments (variable or fixed)

 So every transaction can be positive or negative.
 Every transaction can be variable or fixed.
 Every transaction can be planned or unexpected.

 A variable expense must have an alert limit.
 This just means let me know if this goes above a certain amount.

 Every cashflow has a buffer.
 This is the amount of money left over at the end of the cycle.
 If the buffer is too low, then it is time to transfer money from savings.  One of the main cashflow functions is predicting when this will happen.

 Savings can be used to raise the checking buffer if it gets too low.  But savings is NOT the buffer for checking, in fact savings could have a buffer too, if we consider wanting a full month of expenses in savings for an emergency.

 Now, consider if the checking account is the top level cashflow.  Then credit cards are also cashflows.  But a credit card is mostly expenses (negative transactions) with a single payment (positive transaction).  

 Savings is also a cashflow.  It just has a goal of growing and managing unexpected transactions.  The transactions that transfer to savings are for specific purposes, so that becomes a budget, like $500/month for unexpected expenses and $1600/month for investments.  But eventually, they will be used to invest or apply to unexpected expenses.

 In this way, it is a hierarchy of cashflows.  Where one transaction in a cashflow can also refer to another cashflow.
 Like checking account credit card payment referencing the credit card cashflow.

Every transaction has a purpose aka category.

The category can be fixed, or variable with a budget limit.
But the subscription credit card cashflow is a fixed transaction in the checking account, but the general credit card cashflow is variable with a budget limit.

The budget limit can be proposed, like groceries per week, or computed, like total credit card transactions per month.  Either way, this limit is used to predict when the cashflow will run out of money and warn of overspending.

Credit cards, won't ever have a buffer.  That's just a cashflow with a zero buffer.
